          is concerned about the care of his parents, he needs to cover their needs, as well as his
          own. For several years he have heard about chambers of commerce, but are unaware of the role 
          of these institutions. When conducting research on the Internet, he discovers the Nuevo León
          Chamber of Commerce and finds interesting the benefits that are obtained 
          as a member.
