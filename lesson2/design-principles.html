        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>

          Reason Studio's website complies with the design principle of white space and clean design, which 
          allows for better readability and user experience. I can say, that it also complies with the principle 
          of alignment and contrast. During this assignment, I realized that at least a large number of sites 
          do not comply with these design principles, even being recognized brands, they neglect these principles.

        <h3>Alignment</h3>

          Based on uxengineer.com in terms of <a href="https://bit.ly/3M1Y74l">media object alignment</a>, 
          this site complies with this design principle. All elements are aligned in the center, as well as each 
          element is centered in its containers. Three of the images are aligned on the left and their description
          and purchase links are on the right. The website also complies with the design principle of white space, 
          clean design, and contrast. It gives users a good experience and readability.
        </p>

      <div id="website-3">
        <h3>Contrast</h3>

        <img src="images/artic-monkeys.png" alt="a screenshot of the arctic monkeys group website">
        <p>
          Like the previous sites, it is evident that this site complies with the design principles of contrast, 
          good choice of colors, alignment of elements, and white spaces, I believe that it is also objective and 
          without distractions to the user. It has good readability and a good user experience.
